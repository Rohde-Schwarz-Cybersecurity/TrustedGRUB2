=== 2.1 Introduction ===

This file describes the extensions made to transform a standard GRUB2 into a version that offers TCG (TPM) support for granting the integrity of the boot process (trusted boot). This project was highly inspired by the former projects TrustedGRUB and GRUB-IMA. However TrustedGRUB2 was completly written from scratch.

TrustedGRUB2 is measuring all critical components during the boot process, i.e. GRUB2 kernel, GRUB2 modules, the OS kernel or OS modules and so on, together with their
parameters. Please note that the TrustedGRUB2 MBR bootcode has not to be checked here (it wouldn't even be possible). The MBR bootcode has already been measured by the TPM itself. 
Since the TPM is passive, it has no direct ability to check if the integrity of bootloader (and the OS kernel/modules and so on) actually is correct.
This can only be done indirectly by using the seal/unseal functions of the TPM (for details on this topic, you should have a look at the TCG specifications or on other documents describing TCG/TPM abilities). 

=== 2.2 Authors ===

The TrustedGRUB2 extensions have been performed by

Daniel Neus <d.neus@sirrix.com>, Sirrix AG security technologies, Bochum, Germany

=== 2.3 Features ===

 * Based on GRUB2 Release 2.0.0
 * TPM Support with TPM detection
 * Measurement of GRUB2 kernel
 * Measurement of all loaded GRUB2 modules
 * Measurement of all commands and their parameters entered in shell and scripts
 * New SHA1-implementation in GRUB2 kernel (necessary for doing the GRUB2 modules measurement as the crypto module isn't loaded at this stage)
 * New commands:
 ** readpcr PCRNUM
 ** tcglog LOGINDEX
 ** measure FILE PCRNUM
 ** setmor DISABLEAUTODETECT 
 * Loader measurements:
 ** linux / linux16
 ** initrd / initrd16
 ** chainloader
 ** ntdlr

=== 2.4 Measurements (in short) ===

 * PCR 8 First sector of TrustedGRUB2 kernel (diskboot.img)
 * PCR 9 TrustedGRUB2 kernel (core.img)
 * PCR 11 contains all grub2-modules loaded
 * PCR 12 contains all commandline arguments from scripts (e.g. grub.cfg) and those entered in the shell
 * PCR 14 contains all files which are actually loaded (e.g. Linux kernel, initrd, etc.)

Kernel measurements are only implemented for diskboot so far (e.g. no cdboot or pxeboot measurement)

=== 2.5 Requirements ===

In order to use the TCG-enhanced TrustedGRUB2, you need a computer which has TCG enhancements according to TCG specs. v1.2, since SHA1-calculations are extended into PC-Registers of the TPM.

=== 2.6 Known Bugs ===

 * On some HP notebooks, TrustedGRUB2 is not able to do the kernel measurements due to a missing / faulty implemented "TCG_CompactHashLogExtendEvent" inside the BIOS. This means PCR 8,9 contain bogus values

If you find any bugs, please contact the author Daniel Neus <d.neus@sirrix.com>

=== 2.7 Configuring TrustedGRUB2 before installation ===

==== 2.7.1 PCR selection ====
PCR selection for module measurement, command measurement and loaded files measurement can be adjusted in tpm_kern.h:

#define TPM_GRUB_LOADED_MODULES_PCR 11
#define TPM_COMMAND_MEASUREMENT_PCR 12
#define TPM_LOADED_FILES_PCR 14

==== 2.7.2 Debug output ====

To enable some debug output uncomment:

/* #define TGRUB_DEBUG */

in tpm_kern.h

=== 2.7 Installation of TrustedGRUB2 ===

Required Packages for compiling:
- autogen
- autoconf
- bison
- flex

To compile and install TrustedGRUB2, please run

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=INSTALLDIR
make
make install

Installing to device:

./INSTALLDIR/sbin/grub-install --directory=INSTALLDIR/lib/grub/i386-pc /dev/sda

[WARNING]
if installing over an old GRUB2 install you probably have to adjust your grub.cfg

For usb-devices this command can be used (assuming /dev/sdb/ is your usb-device):
./INSTALLDIR/sbin/grub-install --directory=INSTALLDIR/lib/grub/i386-pc --root-directory=/mnt/sdb1 /dev/sdb

== 3. General Information ==

=== 3.1 General view on how TrustedGRUB2 works ===

The goal of TrustedGRUB2 is to accomplish a chain of trust, i.e. every component measures the integrity of the succeeding component. 
Concretely, this looks like the following ("<-" means "is checked by"):

   BIOS integrity        			<-  TCG extension
   TrustedGRUB2 MBR bootcode    		<-  TCG extension
   start of TrustedGRUB2 kernel (diskboot.img)	<-  TrustedGRUB2 MBR bootcode
   rest of TrustedGRUB2 kernel (core.img)	<-  start of TrustedGRUB2 kernel
   Grub modules + OS (kernel and so on) 	<-  TrustedGRUB2 kernel

This chain of trust can be extended by using the newly added "measure" command to measure the integrity of arbitrary files.

=== 3.2 Measurement of GRUB2 kernel ===

==== 3.2.1 Modifications in boot.S (MBR bootcode) ====

GRUB2 MBR bootcode is already measured by the TPM. The MBR bootcode has the task to load first sector of TrustedGRUB2 kernel (diskboot.img). Diskboot.img itself loads the rest of GRUB2 kernel. 
Therefore GRUB2 MBR code is extended to measure diskboot.img before jumping to it:

  1.) Diskboot.img is hashed with a SHA-1 algorithm. 
      Diskboot.img ist loaded at address 0x8000, its length is 512 bytes.

  2.) The resulting hash value is written to PCR (Platform Configuration Register) 8.
      More precisely, the former content of this register (which actually is 0) is concatenated to the new value,
      then hashed with SHA1 and finally written again to PCR 8.

Due to the PC architecture, the size of the MBR (where TrustedGRUB2 boot.S is 
located) is limited to 512 bytes. But the original GRUB2 MBR bootcode is already very
close to this limit, leaving very few space for the TCG extensions. Because
of this, it was necessary (in the current version of TrustedGRUB2) to eliminate the CHS-code.
This results in the problem that we support only LBA-discs now. FDD boot is not possible.

==== 3.2.2 Modifications in diskboot.S  ====

boot.S contains the code for loading the first sector of TrustedGRUB2 kernel (diskboot.img). Its only task
is the load the rest of TrustedGRUB2 kernel. Therefore, the TCG extension now has to measure the rest of TrustedGRUB2 kernel
The changes here are widely the same as in TrustedGRUB2 bootcode, with the differences that 
the entry point for the code which has to be checked is a address 0x8200 and that the result is written into PCR 9.

=== 3.3 Measurement of GRUB2 modules ===

Grub2 has a modular structure. GRUB2 dynamically loads needed modules which are not contained in kernel. Modifications in boot.S and diskboot.S are only measuring GRUB2 kernel. 
Therefore the GRUB2 module loader was modified to measure modules to PCR 11 before they are loaded. Changes can be found in dl.c .

=== 3.4 New SHA1-implementation in GRUB2 kernel ===

In order to make GRUB2 modules measurement possible, a SHA1-implementation had to be added to the kernel. 
GRUB2 already contains an SHA1-implementation in its crypto module, but this isn't loaded at this stage.

=== 3.5 Measurement of all commands and their parameters entered in shell and scripts ===

All commands which are entered in shell or executed by scripts is measured to PCR 12. Therefore commands in grub.cfg are automatically measured. No need to measure grub.cfg separatly.

=== 3.6 TrustedGRUB2 commands ===

==== 3.6.1 new commands ====

 ** readpcr PCRNUM

Display current value of the PCR (Platform Configuration Register) within TPM (Trusted Platform Module) at index, PCRNUM.

 ** tcglog LOGINDEX

Displays TCG event log entry at position, LOGINDEX. Type in "0" for all entries.

 ** measure FILE PCRNUM

Perform TCG measurement operation with the file FILE and with PCR( PCRNUM ).

 ** setmor DISABLEAUTODETECT

Sets Memory Overwrite Request (MOR) Bit. DISABLEAUTODETECT specifies if bios should auto detect unscheduled reboots.

==== 3.6.2 Modified existing GRUB2 commands ====

 ** linux / linux16
 ** initrd / initrd16
 ** chainloader
 ** ntdlr

These commands are modified to measure before loading. PCR 14 is extended.

=== 3.7 Other modifications ===

All modifications have been commented with

    /* BEGIN TCG EXTENSION */
              ...
    /* END TCG EXTENSION */

== 4. Thanks ==

TrustedGrub1 and GRUB-IMA have done a lot of preparatory work in the field and were used for code examples. Some of the code is adapted from them.
